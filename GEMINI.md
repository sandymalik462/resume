# Project Context: Resume Workspace

## Directory Overview
This directory, `resume`, is currently a workspace intended for the development and storage of resume-related materials. As of the initial analysis, the directory is empty, suggesting a new project initiation.

## Project Type
**Non-Code / New Project**
The directory does not yet contain source code or configuration files. It is likely intended for:
-   A static website for a resume (e.g., HTML/CSS, Jekyll, Hugo).
-   Document source files (e.g., LaTeX, Markdown).

## Key Files
*   `GEMINI.md`: This file, serving as project context and documentation.

## Usage
This directory is the root for the resume project. Future development should likely include:
1.  **Source Code:** Web technologies or document markup.
2.  **Assets:** Images, PDFs, or styling resources.
3.  **Deployment Config:** Configurations for hosting services like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
